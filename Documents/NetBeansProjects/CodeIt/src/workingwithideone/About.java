By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program\nwhose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the software, or if you modify it.\n \nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n \nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n \nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be\nlicensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n \nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\nMODIFICATION\n \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program\nor any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing\nthe Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program\nis not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been\nmade by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the\nProgram does.\n \n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of\nthe Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n \n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n \na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n \nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.\n \nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\nyou must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\nsuch an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be\non the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to\nthe entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n \n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n \na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n \nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\nany third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\nsource distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\nsource code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n \nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\nnoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object\ncode or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b\nabove.)\n \nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\ncode distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\neither source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\ncomponent itself accompanies the executable.\n \nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to\ncopy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the\nobject code.\n \n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n \n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n \n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of\nthe rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\nby third parties to this License.\n \n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\nyou from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to\nsatisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other\npertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\nProgram at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both\nit and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\nProgram.\n \nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\nsoftware distribution system, which is implemented by public license\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\nsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\ncannot impose that choice.\n \nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n \n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this License.\n \n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\nnew problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,\nyou may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make\nexceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n \nNO WARRANTY\n \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\nLOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.");
